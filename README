This is a rule-based script generator for system environment incremental deployment.

    # on the developer host machine
    ./opsboy samples/openresty-tester.ob -o openresty-tester.pl

    # on the target machine
    ./openresty-test.pl make t-ngx_lua tv-ngx_srcache --git-pull force=1

Installation on the Developer Host Machine

    $ sudo cpan Pegex File::Copy

    This is not required on the target machine though. The target
    machine only needs to have perl 5 installed.
